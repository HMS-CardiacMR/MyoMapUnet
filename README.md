# MyoMapUnet

We implemented and tested three different classes of deep learning architectures for MyoMapNet: (a) a fully connected neural network (FC), (b) convolutional neural networks (VGG19, ResNet50), and (c) encoder-decoder networks with skip connections (ResUNet, U-Net). Modified Look-Locker Inversion Recovery (MOLLI) images from 749 patients at 3T were used for training, validation, and testing. The first four T1 weighted images from MOLLI5(3)3 and/or MOLLI4(1)3(1)2 protocols data were extracted to create accelerated cardiac T1 mapping data. We also prospectively collected data from 28 subjects using MOLLI and LL4 to further evaluate model performance.
